# Arithmetic Operations Script

Welcome to the Arithmetic Operations Script project!

This project features a Bash script that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. It's a simple yet effective tool for demonstrating arithmetic calculations using Bash scripting.

## Project Details

The script does the following:

- **Addition**: Calculates the sum of two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Computes the difference between two numbers.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.
- **Remainder**: Finds the remainder when dividing the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.
- **Exponentiation**: Raises the first number to the power of the second number.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ans-inayat/mathcity.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd mathcity
   
3. **Make the Script Executable**:
  ```bash
   chmod +x mathcity.sh
4. **Run the Script**:
  ```bash
   ./mathcity.sh
